From Covid dataset analysis data using SQL and visualize it using Tableau.
Download the covid dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus
Now seperate the dataset into two one is the Covid deaths and other is the Covid Vaccination in excel sheet and save it separately.
Now import this two excel into SQL and create a new database.
Now explore this data using sql querries.
I have also uploaded the two excel file named CovidDeath and CovidVaccination, so anybody can directly download this two files and directly import it to SQL workbench if found difficulty in download  and editing the data as mention above.
